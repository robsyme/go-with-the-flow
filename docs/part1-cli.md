# Part 1: Critter classification with the command-line

## What is the command-line?

A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with a computer program by inputting lines of text called command-lines ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)). While it may seem daunting at first glance, it is a simple, text-only interface, and incredibly powerful tool that offers a direct way to communicate with and control your computer.

In this section of our Nextflow workshop, we'll explore how to run an existing classification model using OpenAI's CLIP directly from the command-line, to both classify our critters and build a collage of images.

## Step 1: Find the critters

For this exercise, we have created a folder called [`activity/cli/data`](../activity/cli/data) that just contains a copy of all of the original animal images in the top-level [`data/`](../data/) folder.

You can either navigate to this directory via the File Explorer side-bar in the VS Code user interface in Gitpod, or the command-line. This is a good example of how you can do exactly the same thing through the user interface and the command-line.

1. Let's list all of the files in the current directory using the command-line. You should see the `activity` folder as shown below:

   ```console
   ls

   # Output:
   README.md  activity  assets  bin  data  docs  main.nf  nextflow.config  nextflow_schema.json  tower.yml
   ```

2. You can either navigate directly to the `activity/cli/` folder by issuing the command below:

   ```bash
   cd activity/cli
   ```

   or you can run multiple `cd` commands to get there too:

   ```bash
   cd activity
   cd cli
   ```

3. You can check you are in the correct directory by using the [`pwd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd) (print working directory) command:

   ```bash
   pwd

   # Output: /workspace/nf-training-intro/activity/cli
   ```

4. List the contents of the `data` folder:

   ```console
   ls data

   # Output:
   aussie.png  chihuahua.png  dog.png  hiding.png  pug.png  rain-ready.png  reflective.png  yawn.png
   ```

Now that you are in the correct location relative to where the input images are stored, you will be able to run the classification with the images in `data/`.

## Step 2: Label each image

In this step of the tutorial, we will explore how to run an existing classification model using OpenAI's CLIP tool directly from the command-line, to both classify our critters.

The main command we will be using looks like this:

```bash
classify.py --image <YOUR_PICTURE> --labels '<LABEL_1>,<LABEL_2>,<LABEL_3>' > out.txt
```

Let's break this down:

1. `classify.py` is the Python script we have created to run the classification model
2. `--image <YOUR_PICTURE>` specifies the image file we would like to classify as input
3. `--labels '<LABEL_1>,<LABEL_2>,<LABEL_3>'` is the set of labels/classifiers we want to assign to the images
4. `> out.txt` allows us to save the results or output of the classification into a file called `out.txt` that we can read later.

Now let's run the `classify.py` script on a single dog pic called [`rain-ready.png`](../activity/cli/data/rain-ready.png) and see which classifier CLIP assigns to it!

```bash
classify.py --image data/rain-ready.png --labels 'cat,dog,cute_dog'

# Output:
dog
```

This should return a text output onto the command-line telling you which of the input labels was most likely to apply to the picture we specified as input. In this case, the critter was a `'dog'`! We are not limited to the labels we used above, for example, you can also specify `'cat,dog,zebra,crocodile'`, or any other set of labels.

For simplicity, let's use the same labels, classify each of the 8 images individually and then copy them into a folder based on the classification:

1. Precreate individual folders for each label with the [`mkdir`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mkdir) (make directory) command:

   ```bash
   mkdir cat
   mkdir dog
   mkdir cute_dog
   ```

2. Classify each image individually:

   ```console
   classify.py --image data/aussie.png --labels 'cat,dog,cute_dog'

   # Output:
   cute_dog
   ```

   ```console
   classify.py --image data/chihuahua.png --labels 'cat,dog,cute_dog'

   # Output:
   cute_dog
   ```

   ```console
   classify.py --image data/dog.png --labels 'cat,dog,cute_dog'

   # Output:
   dog
   ```

   ```console
   classify.py --image data/hiding.png --labels 'cat,dog,cute_dog'

   # Output:
   cat
   ```

   ```console
   classify.py --image data/pug.png --labels 'cat,dog,cute_dog'

   # Output:
   cute_dog
   ```

   ```console
   classify.py --image data/rain-ready.png --labels 'cat,dog,cute_dog'

   # Output:
   dog
   ```

   ```console
   classify.py --image data/reflective.png --labels 'cat,dog,cute_dog'

   # Output:
   cat
   ```

   ```console
   classify.py --image data/yawn.png --labels 'cat,dog,cute_dog

   # Output:
   cat
   ```

3. Copy each image to a folder based on the classifier label:

   ```bash
   cp data/aussie.png cute_dog
   ```

   ```bash
   cp data/chihuahua.png cute_dog
   ```

   ```bash
   cp data/dog.png dog
   ```

   ```bash
   cp data/hiding.png cat
   ```

   ```bash
   cp data/pug.png cute_dog
   ```

   ```bash
   cp data/rain-ready.png dog
   ```

   ```bash
   cp data/reflective.png cat
   ```

   ```bash
   cp data/yawn.png cat
   ```

   Just out of interest, did your copy paste skills take a carpal tunnel battering there?

Now you should have 3 directories labelled by critter:

1. A `dog/` directory with all of the images that were labelled as `'dog'`
2. A `cat/` directory with all the images labelled as `'cat'`
3. A `cute_dog/` directory with all the images labelled as `'cute_dog'`

You can also list the images that ended up in each directory by using the command-below:

```
ls dog
```

## Step 3: Make a collage for each classifier

Now lets try to create a collage of each of the directories containing label-specific images. We will be using a tool called [`montage`](https://imagemagick.org/script/montage.php) to create the collage. This tool will take as input a list of images and output a collage in png format.

1. Create a `collages` directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir collages
   ```

2. Create a temporary image to make a collage with the correct layout for all of the images in the `'dog'` folder:

   ```bash
   montage -geometry 80 -tile 4x dog/* dog_temp.png
   ```

   The `-geometry 80` and `-tile 4x` parameters will ensure the images in the collage are of uniform size and are arranged in a 4x4 grid pattern, respectively.

   Now, let's repeat this same process for all of the other labels:

   ```bash
   montage -geometry 80 -tile 4x cat/* cat_temp.png
   ```

   ```bash
   montage -geometry 80 -tile 4x cute_dog/* cute_dog_temp.png
   ```

3. Now that we have created a temporary image with the correct layout for each collage, we can add the appopriate label, adjust the size of the frame around the collage, specify a background colour and create an output png file for each label in the `collages` directory. The following commands will do this for each of the labels:

   ```bash
   montage -label dog dog_temp.png -geometry +0+0 -background Gold collages/dog.png
   ```

   ```bash
   montage -label cat cat_temp.png -geometry +0+0 -background Gold collages/cat.png
   ```

   ```bash
   montage -label cute_dog cute_dog_temp.png -geometry +0+0 -background Gold collages/cute_dog.png
   ```

4. Now to be kind to storage let's clean up any intermediate images we don't want to keep.

   ```
   rm dog_temp.png
   rm cat_temp.png
   rm cute_dog_temp.png
   ```

## Step 4: Combine the collages

You should now have a set of collages, one for each critter type.

1. List the images that ended up in the `collages/` directory by using the command-below:

   ```
   ls collages

   # Output:
   cat.png cute_dog.png dog.png
   ```

2. Use `montage` again to combine all of the individual collages into a meta-collage called `collage_all.png`!

   ```bash
   montage -geometry +0+0 -tile 1x collages/* collage_all.png
   ```

   The `-geometry +0+0` parameter will ensure there is no spacing between the collages, and the `-tile 1x` parameter will ensure the images are arranged in a single row of uniform size.

   You can download that final image from the GitPod user interface by right clicking on the `collage_all.png` and clicking 'Download'.

   Take a look - what do you think?

## Conclusions

Try to answer the following questions for yourself:

- What if there were 1000 images? Would you be happy following the above steps for all of them?
- Even if you did, are you confident you would get the commands right if you had to type them out 100 times again?
- How annoyed would you be if you had lost your place half way through and had to start again?

<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>
After classifying a few images one by one, you might notice a couple of things. First, it can be quite tedious to type out or copy-paste the command repeatedly for multiple images. Secondly, this method does not scale well if we have hundreds or thousands of images to classify. Imagine having to run each image through the command-line individually—it would be incredibly time-consuming and inefficient.

## Next steps

We can instead encapsulate these commands into a script. This will not only simplify the process of classifying multiple images but also set the stage for understanding the power of automation and scalability—key features that Nextflow enhances in more complex workflows. Now proceed to the next part: [Part 2: Critter classification with Bash scripting](part2-bash.md).
