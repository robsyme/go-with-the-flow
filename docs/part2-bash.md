# Part 2: Critter classification with Bash scripting

Hopefully, that first approach wasn't too tricky, but it was a bit tedious running all those commands wasn't it? Let's exercise our [3 virtues](https://thethreevirtues.com/) and try to make life easier for ourselves.

## Introduction to Bash and Bash Scripting

[Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>), or the Bourne Again SHell, is a powerful command-line language used widely across Unix-like operating systems. It enables users to execute commands, navigate file systems, and manipulate data. Bash's true potential is unlocked through scripting!

A Bash script is essentially a file containing a series of commands that are executed sequentially by the Bash shell. Writing a script involves encapsulating commands you might normally type on the command-line like you performed in the previous section. Scripting saves you time and reduces the potential for error when performing repetitive tasks. It also allows you to 'loop' through commands, for example, to repeat the same actions with different input files.

## Step 1: Find the critters

For this exercise, we have created a folder called [`exercise/bash/data`](../exercise/bash/data) that contains a copy of all of the original animal images in the top-level [`data/`](../data/) folder.

1. Let's change to the appropriate folder:

   ```console
   cd /workspace/nf-training-intro/exercise/bash
   ```

   ```console
   pwd
   ```

   Which should return:
   >  `/workspace/nf-training-intro/exercise/bash`

2. List the contents of the `data` folder:

   ```console
   ls data
   ```

   Which should return:
   >  `aussie.png  chihuahua.png  dog.png  hiding.png  pug.png  rain-ready.png  reflective.png  yawn.png`

Now that you are in the correct location relative to where the input images are stored, you will be able to run the classification with the images in `data/`.

## Step 2: Run the Bash script

We have written a bash script called [`make_collage.sh`](../exercise/bash/make_collage.sh). Have a look at this script and check that you understand the rough picture of what's going on (the fine detail is unimportant here). We're essentially automating what you did [before](../docs/part1-cli.md), looping over all the input images, classifying them, making a collage for each class and combining those collages at the end.

You should see that running the Bash script below produces the composite collage file `collage_all.png` with a single command!

```console
./make_collage.sh
```

## Quiz

Try to answer the following questions for yourself:

- Is this an improvement compared to the previous exercise?
- Is this more reproducible because we are removing some more human involvement?
- How well will this scale to 1000s of images?
- If this was a more time-consuming task where each image took 10 minutes to classify and there is a power failure at GitPod HQ, would we be able to resume the sequence of commands?
- What would happen if you copied this script to a different computer where the required software hasn't already been installed in the executing environment?
- What if someone in the host environment changes what the `classify.py` command does?

## Summary

While Bash scripts offer more efficiency and scalability over running individual CLI commands, there is still an important limitation with respect to reproducibility and scalability. For instance, executing the same script across different computers, or environments might yield varying results due to differences in software versions, operating systems, or configurations. Moreover, Bash scripts can become unwieldy as the complexity of the tasks increases, especially when dealing with larger datasets or when requiring parallel processing.

In the next section of the workshop, [Part 3: Critter classification with Nextflow](part3-nextflow.md), we will show how Nextflow comes to the rescue! Nextflow is designed to address these limitations by enabling scalable and reproducible scientific workflows. It allows you to write pipelines that are portable across multiple execution environments to ensure consistent results. Nextflow also simplifies complex data-driven processes to automate and execute tasks in parallel.
